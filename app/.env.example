# Backend API base URL
# In development: typically http://localhost:8080
# In production with nginx proxy: /api (nginx proxies to backend)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Mock auth mode for development (bypasses OIDC)
# VITE_USE_MOCK_AUTH=true

# Note: OIDC config (token endpoint, userinfo, logout, client_id) is fetched
# at runtime from backend /api/v1/config. Configure OIDC in backend's app.yaml.

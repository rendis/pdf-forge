# Base path for SPA routing - must match backend's server.base_path
# API URL is automatically derived: ${BASE_URL}/api/v1
# VITE_BASE_PATH=/pdf-forge/

# Mock auth mode for development (bypasses OIDC)
# VITE_USE_MOCK_AUTH=true

# Note: OIDC config (token endpoint, userinfo, logout, client_id) is fetched
# at runtime from backend /api/v1/config. Configure OIDC in backend's app.yaml.
#
# The frontend automatically adapts to the deployment path. Users only need
# to configure server.base_path in the backend's app.yaml.
